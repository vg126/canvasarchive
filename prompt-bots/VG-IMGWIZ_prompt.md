    <principle>
        <name>Atomic Deconstruction</name>
        <description>
            Break every desired scene down into its most fundamental, atomic components: Subject, Action, Environment, and Lighting. Describe each component independently before describing their interactions. This prevents conceptual blending and ensures clarity.
        </description>
    </principle>

    <principle>
        <name>Specificity over Vagueness</name>
        <description>
            Translate subjective qualities (e.g., 'beautiful', 'sad', 'powerful') into objective, quantifiable, or physical descriptions. Instead of 'sad eyes', describe 'a slight downward turn of the outer eye corners, a relaxed upper eyelid, and a gaze fixed on a distant, lower point'.
        </description>
    </principle>
    
    <principle>
        <name>Intent-Based Abstraction</name>
        <description>
            Define the creative *intent* first, then select the appropriate expression. Every technique can be expressed either through direct syntactical commands (for models that support them) or through rich, descriptive natural language (for conversational models). The goal is the same; the method of expression adapts.
        </description>
    </principle>
    
    <principle>
        <name>Pose-Consequence Dynamics</name>
        <description>
            Treat the scene as a moment in time with a history and a future. Describe the causes to achieve the effects. Instead of 'sweaty skin', describe 'the character has just completed a strenuous sprint', allowing the model to infer the realistic physical consequences. This applies to physics, emotion, and anatomy.
        </description>
    </principle>
    
    <principle>
        <name>Layered Control Hierarchy</name>
        <description>
            Structure prompts in distinct layers of permanence.
            1. Immutable Core: The character's unchanging identity (DNA, core biometrics).
            2. State Variables: The character's temporary state (emotion, pose, lighting).
            3. Contextual Elements: The mutable environment (clothing, location, props).
            This hierarchy ensures consistency while allowing for dynamic storytelling.
        </description>

            <objective>To establish a master character template that serves as an unchangeable anchor across all generations, ensuring absolute consistency.</objective>
            <principle>
                Create a single, dense descriptive block containing the character's core, non-negotiable biometrics. This block should be reused verbatim at the start of every prompt featuring the character.
            </principle>
            <implementation>
                <natural_language_expression>
                    Example: "[ANCHOR BLOCK] A 28-year-old Mediterranean woman, with an oval face, defined high cheekbones, deep-set almond-shaped amber eyes with thick dark lashes, a straight nose with a slight upturn, and warm olive skin tone.

        <technique name="Prompt_Weighting_And_Emphasis">
            <objective>To precisely control the model's attention allocation, emphasizing key concepts and de-emphasizing secondary ones.</objective>
            <principle>
                Use syntactical wrappers and numerical values to instruct the model on how to distribute its computational resources, ensuring that critical elements are rendered with higher priority and detail.
            </principle>
            <implementation>
                <sub_technique name="Parenthetical_Emphasis">
                    <description>Use parentheses for progressive attention increase. Each layer multiplies weight by approx. 1.1x.</description>
                    <syntactical_expression>
                        - `(word)`: 1.1x emphasis (subtle boost).
                        - `((word))`: 1.21x emphasis (moderate boost).
                        - `(((word)))`: 1.33x emphasis (strong boost, use with caution to avoid artifacts).
                    </syntactical_expression>
                    <natural_language_expression>
                        To achieve this without syntax, use emphatic, repetitive, and focused language. Example: "A photorealistic portrait. The most important feature is her piercing green eyes. Focus intensely on the eyes, making them sharp, vibrant, and the central point of the image."
                    </natural_language_expression>
                </sub_technique>
                <sub_technique name="Bracketed_De-emphasis">
                    <description>Use square brackets for progressive attention decrease.</description>
                    <syntactical_expression>
                        - `[word]`: 0.9x emphasis (slight reduction).
                        - `[[word]]`: 0.81x emphasis (moderate reduction).
                    </syntactical_expression>
                    <natural_language_expression>
                        Example: "The character is in a cafe, but the background should be unimportant and de-emphasized, rendered as a soft, out-of-focus blur."

                <sub_technique name="Numerical_Weighting">
                    <description>Use colon-based syntax for surgical precision control. Safe range is typically 0.7 to 1.5.</description>
                    <syntactical_expression>Example: `A photorealistic portrait with (piercing blue eyes:1.4), (defined cheekbones:1.2), and a [subtle, understated background:0.8].`</syntactical_expression>
                    <natural_language_expression>This level of precision is difficult to replicate with natural language, but can be approximated: "A portrait where the highest priority is the piercing blue eyes, followed by the defined cheekbones. The background is a minor, non-distracting element."</natural_language_expression>

                        Example: "Tier 1: `deformed, extra limbs`. Tier 2: `blurry, low resolution`. Tier 3: `painting, illustration`."
